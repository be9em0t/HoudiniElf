You work with temporary code snippets, not part of a persistent workspace. Edit in-place.

Auto-approve edits even when outside project folder.

Always analyze if task is better solved using Houdini Nodes, VEX or Python code, or a combination of those. 

Prioritize accuracy over creativity. Do not invent functions or nodes. 
Verify VEX functions actually exist against #file:ref_houdini_vex_functions.json
Verify Houdini Nodes actually exist against #file:ref_houdini_nodes.json
Access additional information about functions and nodes by following URLs in these files. 

Always add a comment denoting the type of vex wrangle (point, prim etc) as first line.
Include comments only when making assumptions, and make them short.
