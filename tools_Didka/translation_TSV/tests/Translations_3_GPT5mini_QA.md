QA complete for the entire file. Below are rows that need review (row label — reason — suggested action).

Drive Through Bottle Shop — SR/BG contain English "Drive-through"; RO uses "drive-thru" — mixed-script / English loanword. Suggest: localize (e.g., Бутиков магазин с обслужване през автомобил / Магазин за бутилки с обслужване през автомобил / Magazin băuturi cu servire drive‑through or keep canonical localized term).
Drive-In Cinema — SR/BG contain English "Drive-in"; RO Cinema drive-in — mixed-script. Suggest: localize or keep loanword consistently (e.g., Кино drive‑in → decide policy).
Hot Pot Restaurant — BG/RO keep English "hot pot" (BG: Ресторант hot pot, RO: Restaurant hot-pot) — inconsistent loanword use. Suggest: standardize (either keep loanword without hyphen or use local descriptive label).
Parkway — RO Parkway (English) — consider Alee, Bulevardă, or keep if intentional.
Sushi Restaurant — RO Sushi bar (English) — if you prefer localized POI style, consider Local Sushi vs keep Sushi bar.
Wine Bar — RO Wine bar (English) — consider Vinotecă or Bar de vin.
Steak House — RO Steakhouse (English) — consider Restaurant steack vs Steakhouse standardization.
Mountain Bike Trail — RO Traseu mountain bike — mixed English; suggest Traseu MTB or Traseu de mountain‑bike (or fully localized).
Sailing Club — RO Club de sailing — mixed English; suggest Club de sailing → Club de yachting / Club de navigaţie / Club de sailing (choose style).
Soul Food — RO Restaurant soul food — English loanword; consider localized description or keep as POI brand-style.
Club/venue names using English sports terms: Netball, Snooker, Snack-bar, Skateboard, etc. — many are acceptable as common international terms, but confirm whether to localize (e.g., snooker → снукър/снукър is fine).
SR/BG mixed-script occurrences found beyond the two drive cases (search highlights): any SR/BG cell containing ASCII substrings like Drive-through, Drive-in, Parkway, Hot Pot, Gogoșerie is intentional — confirm policy for loanwords.
Notes:

I checked column structure (all rows have 4 columns) and script usage; most SR/BG entries use Cyrillic correctly.
Romanian diacritics appear in many entries (e.g., Gogoșerie, Gara internaţională, Şcoală), but Romanian entries that intentionally use English/brand terms do not — those are flagged above for style consistency only.
No placeholder patterns (e.g., {0}) were found.
