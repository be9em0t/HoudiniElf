✅ Light Wrapping
Instead of using dot(normal, lightDir) directly, wrap the light around the edges:

plaintext
wrap = saturate(dot(normal, lightDir) + wrapFactor)
---
✅ BacklightThrough Simulation
Use the View Direction and Normal to simulate light coming through from behind:

plaintext
backlight = saturate(1 - dot(viewDir, normal))

---
Thickness Map (Optional)
If your mesh has a baked thickness map (or vertex color), use it to modulate the effect:

plaintext
finalSSS = backlight * thickness * sssColor
You can fake thickness using ambient occlusion, vertex colors, or even distance from center.

---
Transmission Ramp
Use a Fresnel-like ramp to simulate edge glow:

plaintext
fresnel = pow(1 - dot(viewDir, normal), exponent)
Blend this with your base color or emission.

---
Bonus: Emission-Based Glow
If you want internal light to “leak” out:

Use the backlight or fresnel ramp to drive Emission.

Clamp and bias it to avoid full bloom.

Add a Color Tint and Intensity slider for control.

----

Optional Blend Logic
plaintext
finalColor = baseColor * wrapped + sssColor * backlight
Or if you're going stylized:

plaintext
finalEmission = wrapped * warmGlow + backlight * coolRim
