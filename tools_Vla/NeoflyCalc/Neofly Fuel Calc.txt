Aircraft settings:
Model: Asobo C208B Cargo
Max. fuel: 2034 lbs
Range: 964 n.m.
Cruise speed: 195 ktas

Flight settings:
Fuel reserve: 10%
Flight distance: 336 n.m.

Results:
Fuel to load = lbs
Fuel needed for flight =  lbs
Fuel consumption rate =  lbs/n.m.
Expected fule flow = pph

Formula:
1. Fuel consumption rate = Max. fuel / Range
2. Fuel needed for flight = Fuel consumption rate * Flight distance
3. Fuel to load = Fuel needed for flight * (1 + Fuel reserve)


Calculation:
Fuel consumption rate = 2034 lbs / 964 n.m. = 2.11 lbs/n.m.
Fuel needed for flight = 2.11 lbs/n.m. * 336 n.m. = 709.96 lbs
Fuel to load = 709.96 lbs * (1 + 0.10) = 780.96 lbs
