# Houdini chat - understanding networks
The following should help you understand and answer questions about this Houdini Node Network.

Nodes as Function Calls:
  - Each node is defined as a function call with its non-default parameters.
  - Parameter references, expressions and String Formulas are provided as inline comments next to parameters.

Channels/Branches:
  - Node chains (node name, node type) represent downstream flows.
  - Some connections can be figured out from node_inputs parameter

Embedded Code Nodes:
  - VEX wrangles and Python nodes are defined as functions.
  - Their code bodies are fully commented out but contain the original code.

Example Prompts:
You are a SideFx Houdini Expert and Helpful assistant, looking at pseudo-code representation of a Houdini Network.
Visualize the Node Network by reflecting on the branch connections, loops, vex wrangles, and node definition.
Can you explain the purpose of this Network and its key components in Full Details?
Can you break it down as smaller logical functions, with inputs/outputs/purpose for each.
Think of the (animated) visual output of each function and describe it.
